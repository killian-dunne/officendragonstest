## Comments
Hi Wilson, I hope all is well. Here are some remarks about the code. 

I did this without asking questions. In a work environment I would usually clarify what you're looking for throughout the process and would let you know if I'm planning on taking an approach I'm unsure is best. In this case, I appreciate there's more flexibility in what I build so I decided not to bother you with details. That said, let me know if you had something different in mind. 

It should be responsive everywhere for all common device sizes. 

I've added some error handling and done some testing although can add more if you want to see how I'd approach some of that.

Lastly, if there's anything else you'd like me to add, an approach you'd like to see take or a bug here or there then be sure to let me know ([killian.dunne97@gmail.com](mailto:killian.dunne97@gmail.com)). 

Cheers
